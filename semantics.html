        <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
        <p>
          The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of
          WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi that was transferred from
          the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the
          establishment of WWF.

      <h1>HTML Semantics Elements</h1>
      <p>
        Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning
        in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as
        &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; are all considered
        semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element
        and the type of content that is inside them.
